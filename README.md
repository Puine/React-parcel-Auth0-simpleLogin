# React Parcel Auth0 Simple Authentification

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs** boxes. The default URL is `http://localhost:1234/callback`.  Also configure **Allowed Web Origins** to the default application URL `http://localhost:1234`.

Install the dependencies for the app.

```
npm install
```
